# Intelligent Video Content Search System

This system enables **semantic search** within videos ‚Äî allowing users to locate specific objects or words and jump directly to those points in the video. It enhances accessibility and navigation, with responses returned in under 20 seconds.

---

## Features

- **Fast Navigation**: Jump to relevant timestamps in a video via keywords.
- **Semantic Understanding**: Combines image captioning and object detection.
- **Efficient Search**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) + semantic vector search.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saanvibehele/intelligent-video-content-search-system.git
cd intelligent-video-content-search-system
```

### 2. Set Up a Python Environment

source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download YOLO Model Weights

You need to download a pretrained YOLOv8 model file (`yolov8s-world.pt`) from Ultralytics:

```bash
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8.3.0/yolov8s-world.pt
```

Place the `yolov8s-world.pt` file in your project directory.

---

## Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the interface or make search queries.

---

## Run with Docker (Optional)

Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t intelligent-video-content-search-system .
docker run -p 5000:5000 intelligent-video-content-search-system
```

---

## Notes

- Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed if you're processing videos into frames using OpenCV.
